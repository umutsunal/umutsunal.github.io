## Capture the Treasure!

This game is developed in WebGL2, and compatible with the web browsers. (Not compatible with mobile, for now.) In addition, **Three.js** and **Cannon.js** public JS libraries are used in development.

The aim is to leave the room, and obtain the treasure chest by completing the parkour.

Note: This game is still in development. The game below isn't the full version.
